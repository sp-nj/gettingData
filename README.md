Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


## run_anaylysis.R
This R script will create 2 resulting data sets.
* mergedData - the full set of mean and standard deviation measurements
* tidyData - a summarization of the data by subject and activity with the mean of each of the full set variables calculated

Additionally, the tidyData set will be written to the default workspace

## UCI HAR Dataset
This is the raw Samsung dataset, unzipped to this location. The script assumes that files have been left in their original place.
